🐍 Java Snake Game
This project is a fully functional Snake Game developed entirely in Java, utilizing the Swing framework for graphical user interface rendering and real-time game interaction. The objective of the game is to control the snake, collect food, and grow as long as possible without colliding with walls or itself. The game logic is driven by an efficient game loop, responsive user input handling, and robust collision detection algorithms.

🔧 Project Overview
The Snake Game was designed following object-oriented programming principles to ensure clean code structure, reusability, and scalability. The game loop leverages Java’s built-in timer utilities to manage real-time snake movement, while keyboard events are captured using Swing's event listeners to allow smooth directional control.

All rendering operations, including snake body, food generation, score updates, and game-over screens, are handled within custom JPanel components. The game dynamically increases difficulty as the snake grows, providing a progressive challenge for the player.

🍎 Dynamic Food Generation: Randomized food spawning across the grid.

📈 Scoring System: Real-time score tracking based on collected food items.

🖥️ Graphical User Interface: Developed using Java Swing with custom painting for snake rendering.

🧮 Object-Oriented Design: Modular class structure separating game logic, UI rendering, and user input.

🔄 Restart Functionality: Allows restarting the game after game over without restarting the application.

📊 Scalable Grid-Based System: Easy to modify grid size, snake speed, and game difficulty.
